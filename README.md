# creation of BMI-CALCULATOR.
A Body Mass Index (BMI) app is a digital tool designed to help users assess their overall health based on their weight and height. Users input their weight and height, and the app calculates their BMI, providing a numerical score. It then categorizes the result into different health ranges (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight).
